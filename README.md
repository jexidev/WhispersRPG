# WhispersRPG

*The seed of a text-based RPG.*

**WhispersRPG** is an experimental narrative game built in Python, blending grounded realism with a shimmer of the uncanny. It’s an interactive fiction project shaped by memory, mystery, and moral choice—where every line of dialogue and every quiet decision shifts the story’s tone beneath the surface.

This project is part learning journey, part creative outlet. The goal is to build a modular, replayable RPG system using Python, with a strong focus on:
- Immersive worldbuilding and subtle choice-driven narrative
- Moral nuance through invisible alignment systems (light/dark)
- Player agency woven into in-world moments, not setup screens

The first chapter introduces the player to the forgotten town of **Marrowick** (working name), where strange figures watch from the mist and the past feels unusually present.

> *Built one scene at a time. Grown from a whisper.*
